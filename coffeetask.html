                    coffee-based drink that is now enjoyed by people worldwide and is similar to the French drink cafe

                <p class="dptn2">Caramel Macchiato is a signature drink of Starbucks that is similar to Frappuccino in
                    taste and can be brewed in close to 5 minutes. It is perfect for parties or for an evening tea

                <img class="img3" src="./image/cafe mocha.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="dptn3">Cafe mocha is a blend of hot chocolate and cappuccino that is prepared by mixing
                    chocolate powder with an espresso shot, which is then mixed with skimmed steamed milk, foam and
                    whipped cream. For this process, you will need one espresso shot, one spoon of chocolate powder,
                    half a cup of steamed milk and 2-3 cm of microfoam.</p>

                <img class="img4" src="./image/espresso coffee.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="dptn4">Espresso is a form of concentrated coffee that is usually served as shots. All espresso
                    based drinks have three common ingredients: espresso, steamed milk and foam. The process of making
                    espresso is called pulling a shot in which hot water is pressurized and poured over finely grounded
                    coffee beans. All espresso have cream in them which is the froth over it in brownish-red color and
                    gives the rich flavor and smell to the coffee.</p>

                <img class="img5" src="./image/frappuccino.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="dptn5">Frappuccino is a signature drink of Starbucks but is now available in almost all local
                    coffee shops. The essential ingredients in a frappuccino are ice, espresso, whole milk, and flavored
                    syrup. It takes somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes to prepare it. The best part about this drink is
                    that it is topped with a large and thick whipped cream, adding the right amount of sweetness to this
                    drink.</p>

            <div class="coffee6">
                <img class="img6" src="./image/turkish coffee.webp" alt="">
                <p class="dptn6">Turkish coffee, also known as Oriental coffee, is a popular beverage that is enjoyed
                    throughout the Middle East. It is made in a long handled pot which is mostly made of copper or brass
                    and is called cezve or ibrik. Ibrik or cezve is usually a long handled pot that comes with a narrow
                    neck and a wider bottom. One rule of thumb for making this exotic drink is to ensure that your
                    coffee is finely grounded – they cannot be coarse.</p>
